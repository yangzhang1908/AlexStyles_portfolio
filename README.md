# Alex Styles - Graphic Designer Portfolio
This project is build for coursera activities, as practice code.
This repository contains the source code for a modern, responsive portfolio website for Alex Styles, a fictional graphic designer. 
The project was developed to showcase proficiency in front-end web development, focusing on clean design, responsive layouts, and interactive user experiences.

An AI assistant, Microsoft Copilot, was utilized throughout the development process to generate code, suggest enhancements, and optimize the final product.

Deployment on GitHub Pages
To deploy this project and make it publicly accessible, you can use GitHub Pages:

## Activity 1: Foundational CSS & Styling

Code Generation: Copilot was used to generate the initial CSS for the project. This included defining a modern color scheme, setting up professional typography with web-safe fonts, and creating the basic layout structure using Flexbox for the navigation bar and CSS Grid for the portfolio section.
Enhancements: It suggested and implemented advanced styling techniques, such as subtle box-shadow for depth and transition effects for interactive elements like buttons and links, making the site feel more dynamic.
## Activity 2: Responsive Design

Media Queries: Copilot generated the media query boilerplate for standard breakpoints (mobile, tablet, desktop). It provided responsive CSS rules to adjust font sizes for readability, re-stack elements in the contact form for mobile layouts, and modify the portfolio grid to ensure it looks great on any device.
Flexible Layouts: It assisted in refining the Flexbox and Grid properties within the media queries to ensure layouts were fluid and adapted seamlessly to different screen widths.
## Activity 3: UI/UX Enhancements

Interactive Elements: Copilot was instrumental in building the interactive features. It generated the complete HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code for the portfolio modal, including the functions to open and close it. It also provided the CSS for the navigation tooltips.
Visual Polish: It suggested visual enhancements, such as fade-in animations for sections as they load, which were implemented using CSS @keyframes. This added a professional and polished feel to the final user experience.
In summary, Copilot acted as an efficient assistant, accelerating the development process by handling boilerplate code, suggesting modern design patterns, and helping to quickly implement complex features.
